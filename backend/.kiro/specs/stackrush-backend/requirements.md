### Requirement 5: Achievement and Gamification System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to earn achievements and track my progress so that I feel motivated to continue learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes actions THEN the system SHALL check achievement criteria and unlock appropriate rewards
2. WHEN achievements are unlocked THEN the system SHALL award XP points and update user level
3. WHEN user statistics are calculated THEN the system SHALL track streaks, completion rates, and performance metrics
4. IF achievement criteria are met THEN the system SHALL create achievement records with unlock timestamps
5. WHEN leaderboards are generated THEN the system SHALL rank users by XP, completion rate, and other metrics
6. WHEN user profiles are viewed THEN the system SHALL display earned achievements and current statistics

### Requirement 6: Code Review and Social Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to participate in code reviews so that I can learn from others and improve my coding skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests code review THEN the system SHALL create a review session with submission details
2. WHEN reviewers provide feedback THEN the system SHALL store comments with line numbers and timestamps
3. WHEN code reviews are completed THEN the system SHALL calculate quality metrics and provide scores
4. IF review comments are added THEN the system SHALL notify relevant users via real-time updates
5. WHEN review status changes THEN the system SHALL update the submission record and notify participants
6. WHEN review history is requested THEN the system SHALL return paginated reviews with filtering options

### Requirement 7: Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to access comprehensive analytics so that I can understand user behavior and platform performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide user engagement metrics and challenge statistics
2. WHEN performance data is queried THEN the system SHALL return aggregated metrics for specified time periods
3. WHEN user analytics are generated THEN the system SHALL include progress tracking, skill assessment, and activity patterns
4. IF challenge analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide difficulty analysis, completion rates, and user feedback
5. WHEN platform metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL include user growth, retention rates, and feature usage
6. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL support data export in multiple formats

### Requirement 8: Security and Data Protection
