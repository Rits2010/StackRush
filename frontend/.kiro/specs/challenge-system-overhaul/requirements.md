# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely overhauling the existing challenge system by replacing all current challenges with new real-life scenario challenges. The system must maintain the current design aesthetic while ensuring each challenge type (Frontend, Backend API, DSA) has appropriate testing mechanisms and execution environments. The goal is to provide developers with authentic, practical coding experiences that mirror real workplace scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Challenge Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work on frontend challenges that show live previews, so that I can see my code changes in real-time and validate the visual output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a frontend challenge THEN the system SHALL provide a live preview pane showing the rendered output
2. WHEN a user modifies frontend code THEN the preview SHALL update automatically within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a frontend challenge is completed THEN the system SHALL run automated visual regression tests to validate the implementation
4. IF a frontend challenge includes responsive design requirements THEN the preview SHALL include mobile and desktop viewport options
5. WHEN a user submits a frontend challenge THEN the system SHALL validate HTML semantics, CSS compliance, and accessibility standards

### Requirement 2: Backend API Challenge Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work on backend API challenges with interactive testing tools, so that I can test my API endpoints and validate responses in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a backend API challenge THEN the system SHALL provide an integrated API testing interface similar to Postman
2. WHEN a user implements an API endpoint THEN they SHALL be able to send HTTP requests and view responses within the challenge environment
3. WHEN a backend challenge is submitted THEN the system SHALL run automated integration tests against the implemented endpoints
4. IF an API challenge requires database operations THEN the system SHALL provide a sandboxed database environment
5. WHEN API tests are executed THEN the system SHALL validate response status codes, data structure, and business logic compliance

### Requirement 3: DSA Challenge Validation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want DSA challenges to automatically validate my solutions against comprehensive test cases, so that I can verify correctness and performance without manual checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a DSA solution THEN the system SHALL execute the code against predefined test cases automatically
2. WHEN DSA code is tested THEN the system SHALL validate both correctness and time/space complexity requirements
3. WHEN a DSA challenge includes edge cases THEN the system SHALL test against boundary conditions and invalid inputs
4. IF a DSA solution fails any test case THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback about the failure without revealing the test case details
5. WHEN DSA performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL measure execution time and memory usage against expected benchmarks

### Requirement 4: Immutable Test Case System

**User Story:** As a challenge administrator, I want test case files to be completely non-editable by users, so that challenge integrity is maintained and solutions cannot be gamed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any challenge THEN test case files SHALL be read-only and hidden from the file explorer
2. WHEN the system executes tests THEN test cases SHALL be loaded from a secure, isolated environment
3. IF a user attempts to modify test files THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN challenges are loaded THEN test case validation SHALL occur in a sandboxed environment separate from user code execution
5. WHEN test results are displayed THEN only pass/fail status and general feedback SHALL be shown, not the actual test case content

### Requirement 5: Real-Life Scenario Challenge Content

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work on challenges that simulate actual workplace scenarios, so that I can practice skills that directly apply to my professional development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing challenges THEN each challenge SHALL represent a realistic workplace scenario with authentic context and constraints
2. WHEN a challenge is presented THEN it SHALL include background story, stakeholder requirements, and business context
3. IF a challenge involves team collaboration THEN it SHALL simulate realistic communication patterns and interruptions
4. WHEN challenges are categorized THEN they SHALL reflect common industry tasks such as bug fixes, feature development, and system optimization
5. WHEN challenge difficulty is assessed THEN it SHALL be based on real-world complexity rather than artificial algorithmic puzzles

### Requirement 6: Smooth Execution Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all challenges to run smoothly without technical issues, so that I can focus on solving problems rather than dealing with platform limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any challenge type is executed THEN the system SHALL provide consistent performance across all challenge categories
2. WHEN code is compiled or interpreted THEN the process SHALL complete within 10 seconds for typical solutions
3. IF a challenge requires external dependencies THEN they SHALL be pre-installed and readily available
4. WHEN switching between challenge types THEN the environment SHALL adapt automatically without requiring manual configuration
5. WHEN errors occur during execution THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages with debugging context

### Requirement 7: Project Structure and Package Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want challenges to include proper file structures with package.json files, so that I can work with realistic project setups and dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a challenge is loaded THEN the system SHALL provide a complete folder structure with package.json and necessary configuration files
2. WHEN a user accesses the simulation page THEN the system SHALL automatically run npm install if node_modules are missing
3. WHEN dependencies are being installed THEN the terminal SHALL show real-time installation progress
4. IF a challenge requires specific dependencies THEN they SHALL be pre-defined in the package.json file
5. WHEN the project structure is created THEN it SHALL include appropriate folders (src, tests, public, etc.) based on the challenge type

### Requirement 8: Functional Terminal Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to a fully functional terminal that behaves like an actual terminal, so that I can run commands, install packages, and debug my code naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the terminal THEN it SHALL support all standard terminal commands (ls, cd, mkdir, rm, etc.)
2. WHEN npm commands are executed THEN they SHALL work exactly like in a real development environment
3. WHEN the terminal is used THEN it SHALL maintain command history and support tab completion
4. IF the user runs build or test commands THEN they SHALL execute properly and show real-time output
5. WHEN multiple terminal sessions are needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple terminal tabs or windows

### Requirement 9: Pre-configured API Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API challenges to have pre-configured endpoint URLs and test scenarios, so that I can focus on implementation rather than setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backend API challenge is loaded THEN all endpoint URLs SHALL be pre-configured and immutable
2. WHEN API tests are provided THEN they SHALL include sample payloads that users can modify
3. WHEN users test API endpoints THEN they SHALL be able to change request bodies and parameters but not the base URLs
4. IF authentication is required THEN test credentials SHALL be pre-configured and documented
5. WHEN API documentation is displayed THEN it SHALL show all available endpoints with example requests and responses

### Requirement 10: UI Stability and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the simulation page to remain stable without scrolling issues, so that I can focus on coding without interface distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation page is loaded THEN it SHALL maintain a fixed layout without unexpected scrolling
2. WHEN code is being executed or tests are running THEN the page SHALL remain stable and not auto-scroll
3. WHEN terminal output is generated THEN only the terminal area SHALL scroll, not the entire page
4. IF the preview pane updates THEN it SHALL not cause the main page to scroll or jump
5. WHEN switching between different challenge components THEN the page position SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 11: Enhanced Challenge Data

**User Story:** As a challenge administrator, I want comprehensive and realistic challenge data with proper test cases, so that developers get authentic coding experiences.
