6. WHEN the simulation includes distractions THEN they SHALL be presented as realistic workplace interruptions
7. WHEN the terminal is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned appropriately without requiring excessive scrolling
8. WHEN the user interacts with the terminal THEN it SHALL be fully functional using WebContainer technology
9. WHEN the simulation page loads THEN the page height SHALL remain fixed and not grow unexpectedly
10. WHEN the user searches in the file explorer THEN the search functionality SHALL work properly to filter files

### Requirement 5: Controlled Challenge Start Process

**User Story:** As a user starting a challenge, I want a clear modal dialog that confirms my intent to begin and explains the challenge rules, so that I don't accidentally start challenges or miss important information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks start challenge THEN a modal SHALL appear with challenge overview and rules
2. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN it SHALL prevent accidental challenge starts by requiring explicit confirmation
3. WHEN the user confirms starting THEN the modal SHALL provide a countdown or preparation phase
4. WHEN the challenge begins THEN the timer SHALL start only after user confirmation
5. WHEN the user tries to submit without starting THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and show appropriate messaging
6. WHEN the modal is shown THEN it SHALL include challenge-specific information and expectations

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Test Case System

**User Story:** As a user completing coding challenges, I want to see test cases that validate my solution and provide clear feedback on success or failure, so that I can understand whether my code meets the requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test cases are displayed THEN they SHALL be shown in a dedicated, uneditable panel
2. WHEN the user submits a solution THEN all test cases SHALL be executed automatically
3. WHEN test cases pass THEN the user SHALL see a success screen with appropriate celebration
4. WHEN test cases fail THEN the user SHALL see specific failure information and guidance
5. WHEN time runs out THEN the user SHALL see a game over screen with performance summary
6. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL trigger the challenge completion flow

### Requirement 7: Refined Success and Failure Screens

**User Story:** As a user completing challenges, I want success and failure screens that provide meaningful feedback without overwhelming visual effects, so that I can understand my performance and next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully completes a challenge THEN the success screen SHALL display with subtle, professional animations
2. WHEN showing celebration effects THEN they SHALL use confetti animation instead of emoji popups
3. WHEN displaying performance metrics THEN they SHALL be presented in clear, digestible visualizations
4. WHEN the user fails a challenge THEN the failure screen SHALL provide constructive feedback and retry options
5. WHEN showing achievements THEN they SHALL be displayed with appropriate visual hierarchy
6. WHEN the user wants to continue THEN clear navigation options SHALL be provided
